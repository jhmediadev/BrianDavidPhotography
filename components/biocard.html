                        Hello, I’m Brian David<br>
                        My career has spanned over three decades in photography,
                        starting from my high school yearbook ventures to photo
                        journalism for the Orlando Sentinel and Tampa Tribune.
                        Over the years during my spare time, I have photographed people
                        and personal subjects.
                    </p>

                    <p> This grew into a passion to serve more
                        than just a day job, and led me to seek out studio and event
                        photography as another avenue in my life’s work. I hope to
                        work with you in the future, and if there are any questions
                        that I can answer, feel free to connect with me by filling out
                        the form on my contact page. Hope to capture your personal moments soon.

                    </p>
